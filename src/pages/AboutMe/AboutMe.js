            My studies as an electrical engineer gave me experience in
            electronics and the integration of different components (sensors,
            motors and their associated programming). With my work experience as
            an electrical engineer I acquired knowledge mainly in railway
            signaling and power systems and I have experience as Project Manager
            as well.
